# Base Converter

A Python-based exercise focusing on string manipulation, a text-based user interface, the understanding of the underlying mathematics behind computing, and algorithm design.

All six implmented base conversion operations herein (binary to decimal, binary to hexadecimal, decimal to binary, decimal to hexadecimal, hexadecimal to binary, and hexaedecimal to decimal) 
have equivalent built-in Python functions, but none are used. They're useful tools, but one needs to comprehend how they're done, rather than just using them without understanding the underlying principles. 

#Interface

The command line interface allows for simple user navigation and input. It's designed so that the user can always "go up" and never be locked into only being able to move forward by doing a correct operation, while also only accepting valid user input for the conversion processes.

Future iterations of this project will likely involve a GUI menu navigation system instead.
